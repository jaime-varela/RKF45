This quick program implements a Runge-Kutta-Fhelberg method with a
rel_err=0.  Essentially this is the GSL method gsl_odeiv2_step_rkf45
with rel_err = 0.


This program (with optimizations) is about 1.5 - 2.6 times slower than
the GSL method but it has the benefit of being more user friendly and
does not require any external libraries.


The program solves the system:

dy_i(x_j)/dt = F_i(t, x_j, y_j)

see the example for how this is implemented.
